```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Todo

- Setup Git
- Use Rmarkdown
- Push to GitHub
- Use tidyverse
- Organise a project
- Do some work.

## Which way do they want to do it?


## Data

```{r analysis}
  data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmadin/himbr/master/data/seed_root_herbivores.csv")
  data
  
  data %>%
  select(Height, Weight)
  
  plot(Weight ~ Height, data)

  data %>%
  select(Height, Weight)

  data <- data %>%
    mutate(Height_log10 = log10(Height), Weight_log10 = log10(Weight))
  
  pdf("output/figure1.pdf")  
    plot(Weight_log10 ~ Height_log10, data)
  
    mod <- lm(Weight_log10 ~ Height_log10, data)
    x <- sort(data$Height_log10)
    pred <- predict(mod, list(Height_log10=x), interval="prediction")
  
    lines(x, pred[,1])
    polygon(c(x, rev(x)), c(pred[,2], rev(pred[,3])), col=rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.2), border=NA)
    dev.off()
    
    
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
